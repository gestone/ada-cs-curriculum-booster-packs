Ada CS Curriculum Booster Packs
===============================

This is exactly what it is, a collection of supplemental modules for the fantastic [open source curriculum](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum) provided by [Ada Developer's Academy](https://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/).

The Mission of this Project
---------------------------

The goal of this repository is to provide *free high quality* modules to explore core fundamental Computer Science concepts that aren't covered in Ada's curriculum to further demystify the magic of Computer Science.

Each of these modules will cover a single topic and will be broken down into many bite sized 'booster packs' that will contain a small labs to do. After completion of the labs, submit a pull request to the repository so that myself or one of the other maintainers can review it and give feedback.

Why should I take a look at these modules?
------------------------------

Frameworks like [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and even [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) will come and go, but the core computer science fundamentals will largely stay the same. The content across these modules will transend across different languages and as a software engineer, it will be easier to learn whatever hot new technology comes about with the basics in mind.

What languages should I know before attempting to tackle these labs?
------------------------------

Different langauges will be used to demonstrate different concepts when appropriate. It is not important that you master or gain a deep understanding of each language presented. It is more important to understand the underlying concepts behind each lab rather than trying to remember the exact syntax about how to do something in a particular language.

How do I start working on a booster pack?
------------------------------

Start by cloning this repository and open up the `core-modules` directory. Read up on the `README.md` for the booster pack, follow the instructions, and start reading up on the cards!
